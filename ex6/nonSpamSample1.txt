Hi,

I would think that if there is anything close enough then it would be in London, Oxford or in Bristol. There are a number of very good groups in Oxford, especially in Computer Vision, but it might be very hard to get accepted there. I know that Phil Torr is always looking for new candidates though. I've asked a professor at UCL, if they have anything, and according to her they will have an opening in AI quite soon, but the question is whether it will be open for applications from outside UK because of Brexit.

Regards,

MÃ¥rten
